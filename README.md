# What is this?
This repository was created to fill the gap I saw in aggregating measurement and characterization information for ASIC development on "open" PDKs, that may go beyond the information specified in the PDKs themselves. Anything that fits this and serves to help ASIC development (on open processes - though helpful information from closed processes that can nevertheless be accessed is also helpful I guess?) is presumably in scope.

# Contributing
Pull requests and issues welcome.

The repository is seeking transfer to, or contributions from - a (more) knowledgeable maintainer.

I may not actively maintain this repository, or it may be maintained in bursts. Also inspect the issues and PRs for developments.

*Ideally* the repo should be migrated to a format where everything can be contained in the git repo itself for posterity.

# List of "open" processes

## Finished works
## Pending works
(stuff to follow up on, when they get their tapeouts arrive and publish measurements etc...)
For example, how many tinytapeouts have shipped so far?
